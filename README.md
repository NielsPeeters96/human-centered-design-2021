# Human Centered Design @cmda-minor-web 2021

## Application

- Calendar Date Picker for NS
- Make it accessible for Marijn
- Dark mode
- Choose where to travel

## 🔦 **Description**
The tests with Marijn showed that Marijn controls his computer with his left hand and trackpad. In addition, it has a specific for certain buttons, especially the buttons on the front of the keyboard. Think of the space bar and navigate with the arrows. My idea is to make a date picker with different train routes that Marijn uses most often. I am also going to program that different letters get a function, for example to select the date and then change it with the arrows. If I have enough time, I can also add the NS API, so that you select the date and time, then click on a destination and be forwarded to the NS website with the correct information.

## Tests

### Test 1: Datepicker and drag & drop
In the first test I met Marijn. The Wiki contains all data from this observation. Below are the two prototypes that we as a group had made for him to test. During the first meeting I thought it was quite emotional, because I know someone with the same condition. Very nice to see that he leads his own life and has a son and wife.

### Test 2: Testing with Vasillis
In this test I was a little later, because I had to get myself tested for Corona (later it turned out to be positive as well). Marijn had forgotten the agreement and Vasillis had taken it over and had tested our concepts as well as possible in the way Marijn would do it herself. During these tests I came up with an idea to make parts of his keyboard all the same button. So think for example on the left is from Eindhoven to Amsterdam, the right is from Amsterdam to Eindhoven and in the middle is other.

### Test 3: Final test
