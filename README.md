# Human Centered Design @cmda-minor-web 2021

## Application

- Calendar Date Picker
- Drag and drop function
- Maybe a train API?
- Make it accessible for Marijn
- Add Mouse Keys
- Add standard appointments which you can drag and drop on the calendar

## 🔦 **Description**
The tests with Marijn showed that Marijn controls his computer with his left hand and trackpad. In addition, it has a specific for certain buttons, especially the buttons on the front of the keyboard. Think of the space bar and navigate with the arrows. My idea is to make a date picker with different train routes that Marijn uses most often. I am also going to program that different letters get a function, for example to select the date and then change it with the arrows. If I have enough time, I can also add the NS API, so that you select the date and time, then click on a destination and be forwarded to the NS website with the correct information.
